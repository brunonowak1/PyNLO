the data is obtained by digitizing figure 6 in this paper: Broadband chromatic dispersion in fiber-coupled optical interferometry by Allured and Ashcom.

GVD @ 1030 nm = 20.17 fs^2/mm
D @ 1030 nm = -35.81 ps / nm km
TOD @ 1030 nm = 43.6 fs^3/mm
FOD @ 1030 nm = 115 fs^4/mm

The above agrees well with results in: 'Tunable Fiber Lasers based on fiber Bragg grating arrays and a Theta Ring Cavity' by Tobias Tiess where D @ 1030 nm ~ -36 to 38 ps / nm km; and 'Ultrashort Fiber Laser Platform for Seeding of 1-um Laser Amplifier Systems' by Yi Hua where GVD @ 1030 nm = 23 fs^2/mm and TOD = 41 fs^3/mm.

GVD @ 1061 nm = 18.37 fs^2/mm
D @ 1061 = -30.74 ps / nm km

Above doesn't agree very well with 'Measurement of the soliton number in guiding media through continuum generation' by Castello-Lurbe et al. They expect GVD @ 1061 = 24 +-2 ps^2/km

GVD data may need a vertical offset to better match the references.
